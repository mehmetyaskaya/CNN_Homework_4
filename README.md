# CNN_Homework_4,

Hello everyone,

This file contains CNN implementations for different architectures and compares how various parameters affect the performance of each model.

For efficient execution, I recommend running the HW4.ipynb file on Google Colab using a T4 GPU.
You can select the GPU by navigating to:
Runtime → Change runtime type → Hardware accelerator → GPU (T4)
