Hello all,
This file includes the CNN codes for different architectures and compares which parameters how effects the performance of the architecture.
To run to code efficiently I suggest the run this HW4.ipynb file on Google Colab with choosing the T4 GPU. You can choose the GPU from runtime --> change runtime type --> T4 GPU
